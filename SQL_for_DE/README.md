   - Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, etc.)
   - Pivoting and Unpivoting data
   - Regular Expressions (REGEXP_REPLACE, REGEXP_EXTRACT)

7. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**:
   - CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE
   - Indexes (Clustered, Non-Clustered, Composite)
   - Constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK)

    - Integrating SQL Databases with other Data Sources

12. **SQL Best Practices and Coding Standards**:
    - Naming Conventions
    - Error Handling and Logging
    - Code Formatting and Readability

This comprehensive list covers the essential SQL topics that a data engineer should have a strong grasp of. Mastering these concepts will enable data engineers to design, implement, and maintain robust data pipelines, data warehouses, and other data-centric systems.
